@* tasklist1 Template File *@
@* comments:
- taskList isn't just type Any, it will be a Sequence of Strings
- the @ symbol is the one special symbol inside the twirl templates that says this is not a normal text
, it means that you are calling code*@
@(tasks:Seq[String])

@main("Task List") {
  <h2> Task List</h2>
<!-- now actually the view will display the hardcoded values, the tasks that were mentioned in Task1 class-->
  <ul>
    @for(task <- tasks) {
     <li>@task</li>
    }
  </ul>
